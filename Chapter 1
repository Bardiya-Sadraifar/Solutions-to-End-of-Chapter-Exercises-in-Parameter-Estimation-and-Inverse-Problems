Question: 
Consider a mathematical model of the form
G(m)=d,
where m is a vector of length n, and d is a vector of length m. Suppose that the model obeys the superposition and scaling laws and is thus linear. Show that G(m) can be written in the form
G(m)=Γm 
where Γ is an m×n matrix. What are the elements of Γ?
Solution:
import numpy as np
A_true = np.array([[2, -1, 0],
                   [1,  3, 4]])  # shape (m=2, n=3)
def G(m):
    return A_true @ m

m, n = A_true.shape
basis = np.eye(n)
Gamma = np.column_stack([G(basis[:, j]) for j in range(n)])
print("True A:")
print(A_true)
print("\nConstructed Γ (from definition using basis vectors):")
print(Gamma)
m_vec = np.array([1.0, -2.0, 0.5])
lhs = G(m_vec)
rhs = Gamma @ m_vec

print("\nCheck G(m) vs Γ m:")
print("G(m)   =", lhs)
print("Γ m    =", rhs)
print("Are they equal?", np.allclose(lhs, rhs))
